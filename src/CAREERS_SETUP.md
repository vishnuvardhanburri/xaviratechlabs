# 🚀 Careers Section Setup Guide

## Overview

The Careers section allows applicants to submit applications directly through the website. Applications are stored in Supabase and include resume uploads.

---

## 📋 Database Setup

### 1. Create Career Applications Table

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create career_applications table
CREATE TABLE career_applications (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  mobile TEXT NOT NULL,
  division TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL,
  resume_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  resume_filename TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::text, NOW()) NOT NULL
);

-- Create index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_career_applications_created_at ON career_applications(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_career_applications_email ON career_applications(email);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE career_applications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Allow anyone to insert applications (public submission)
CREATE POLICY "Allow public to insert applications"
  ON career_applications
  FOR INSERT
  TO anon
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Policy: Allow authenticated users to read applications (for admin panel)
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to read applications"
  ON career_applications
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);
```

---

## 📁 Storage Setup

### 2. Create Resume Storage Bucket

1. Go to **Storage** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click **New Bucket**
3. Name it: `resumes`
4. Make it **Public** (so admins can download resumes)
5. Click **Create Bucket**

### 3. Set Storage Policies

Run this SQL to allow public uploads:

```sql
-- Allow anyone to upload resumes
CREATE POLICY "Allow public to upload resumes"
  ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT
  TO anon
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'resumes');

-- Allow public to read resumes (so they can be downloaded)
CREATE POLICY "Allow public to read resumes"
  ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT
  TO anon
  USING (bucket_id = 'resumes');

-- Allow authenticated users to delete resumes (admin only)
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete resumes"
  ON storage.objects
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (bucket_id = 'resumes');F
```

## 📧 Email Integration (Future Enhancement)

Currently, applications are stored in Supabase. To receive email notifications:

### Option 1: Supabase Edge Functions (Recommended)

Create a serverless function that sends emails using a service like:
- **SendGrid**
- **Resend**
- **Mailgun**

### Option 2: Database Triggers

Set up a database webhook that triggers when a new application is submitted.

### Example Edge Function:

```typescript
// supabase/functions/send-application-email/index.ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts"

serve(async (req) => {
  const { record } = await req.json()
  
  // Send email using your preferred service
  const response = await fetch('https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${Deno.env.get('SENDGRID_API_KEY')}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      personalizations: [{
        to: [{ email: 'xavira.group@gmail.com' }]
      }],
      from: { email: 'noreply@xavira.com' },
      subject: `New Application: ${record.role}`,
      content: [{
        type: 'text/html',
        value: `
          <h2>New Career Application</h2>
          <p><strong>Name:</strong> ${record.name}</p>
          <p><strong>Email:</strong> ${record.email}</p>
          <p><strong>Mobile:</strong> ${record.mobile}</p>
          <p><strong>Division:</strong> ${record.division}</p>
          <p><strong>Role:</strong> ${record.role}</p>
          <p><strong>Resume:</strong> <a href="${record.resume_url}">Download</a></p>
        `
      }]
    })
  })

  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ success: true }), {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  })
})
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "relation 'career_applications' does not exist"
→ Run the SQL to create the table (step 1)

### "Resume upload failed"
→ Ensure the `resumes` bucket exists and has correct policies

### "Permission denied for storage"
→ Check that storage policies allow anonymous uploads

### Applications not showing in database
→ Verify RLS policies allow inserts from anonymous users
